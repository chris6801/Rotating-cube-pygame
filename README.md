# Introduction
I made this a way to explore making a 3d wireframe cube that rotates and bounces around the screen. Currently it can bounce off the sides but wventually I want to add depth and the ability for the cube to bounce off a wall in the z space and utilize scaling to simulate the depth. 

# Installation 
You'll need python obviously. You can download the latest version here:

This program uses NumPy and PyGame as dependencies. Using pip you can install them with:

`pip install numpy`

`pip install pygame`

# Storing the cube
The cube is stored as a numpy array of each x,y,z point and another numpy array to describe how to connect each point for each edge of the cube.
